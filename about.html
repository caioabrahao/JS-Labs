            <p class="paragraph">The JavaScript Experiment Lab is a Project made by me, <a href="https://github.com/caioabrahao"><strong>Caio AbrahÃ£o</strong></a>, with the intention of learning JavaScript
            and practicing HTML and CSS. <br><br> In the process I created a bunch of small experiments to get the gist of the language.
            Seeing all of those small pieces of code, I decided to group them all together into a fun little web page.
            <br><br> I have intentions to turn this simple page into a learning experience for new programmers such as myself
            to come and learn what they can do with JavaScript and start their journey in the world of Web Development! </p>
