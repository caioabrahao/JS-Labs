<p id="description">The JavaScript Experiment Lab is a Project made by me Caio AbrahÃ£o with the intention of learning JavaScript and practicing HTML and CSS. <br><br> In the process I created a bunch of small experiments to get the gist of the language.
  Seeing all of those small pieces of code I decided to group them all together into a fun little web page. <br><br>I have intentions to turn this simple page into a learning experience for new programmers such as myself to come and learn what they can do with JavaScript and start their journey in the world of Web Development!</p>
